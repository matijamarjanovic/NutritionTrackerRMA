In this project, we developed a comprehensive meal planning and tracking application with a focus on user-friendly design and detailed functionality. The app begins with a splash screen that checks if the user has previously logged in, directing them to the appropriate screen. For new users, a login screen with basic validation is provided.

The home screen features a list of meal categories, each displayed with an image and name. Users can view a description of each category through a dialog box and navigate to a list of dishes by selecting a category. The dish list is designed with paginated viewing to manage the extensive selection.

To refine the user experience, we implemented a filter screen allowing users to search and sort dishes based on categories, regions, and ingredients. This screen supports detailed filtering options and directs users to the appropriate dishes upon selection.

Each dish in the list is displayed with its name and image, with search functionality available by name or ingredient. Detailed information about each dish can be accessed, including its preparation instructions, relevant categories, regions, tags, a YouTube link for video instructions, ingredients with measures, and caloric values.

Users can save dishes to a personal menu, specifying the date and meal type. The app provides an option to capture a new photo for the dish, replacing the default image. Saved dishes are stored in a database, enabling future access and modification.

The application also includes a statistics page, where users can view their meal planning activity over the past week, presented in a graphical format. The app tracks both the number of meals and their caloric content, with visual indicators for daily calorie thresholds.

Additionally, a meal planning page was created, allowing users to organize their meals for the week. The meal plan can be emailed directly from the app, with a link that opens the application for easy access.

Lastly, a user profile page offers insights into the user’s meal preferences, displaying their top favorite dishes, categories, or regions. This page also includes a visual representation of caloric intake, providing a clear overview of the user’s dietary habits.
